>## Developers Mindset
A good developer mindset focuses on **simplicity**, and focusing on helping people when writing a code instead of trying to make a complex code.
A ***simple*** code will be easier to understand and easier to do maintainance and future necessary changes.
Changes should be **resisted** and carefully considered if it is really important to make them or not.
A developer should also be consistent when writing the code. Also, he should prioritize the changes with the ***lowest effort*** and ***highest effect***.

>### some advices for developers are

-Don't be perfectionist, if it works it is good.

-Try to understand what you are doing.

-Don't predict and assume changes.
